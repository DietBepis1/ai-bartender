This is a fun little machine learning project I am making with Vue and Brain.js.

## Version 1.0 (currently in development)

This version of the app will get recipe data from thecocktaildb.com's public api and use it to train a neural network. On the browser side, a user can type in a list of ingredients and brain.js will give them a prediction for a drink. An external link will take the user to that drink's page on 
thecocktaildb.com.

If you want to clone this repo, you can run the dev server and build commands like a vanilla Vue project. At this time, there is no special webpack config or anything to muck up things.
